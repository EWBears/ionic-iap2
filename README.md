<h2>In App Purchase 2 Example with Ionic</h2>

<h3>This code references this blog post [IAP2 - Medium](https://medium.com/p/810c8089010/edit)
<p>This is an example Ionic application with the full code for configuring and buying a product.
  This will only work in an emulator, and it will also fail because you need to edit a few pieces with
  your google and apple product id's, as well as your google play store code in config.xml</p>
